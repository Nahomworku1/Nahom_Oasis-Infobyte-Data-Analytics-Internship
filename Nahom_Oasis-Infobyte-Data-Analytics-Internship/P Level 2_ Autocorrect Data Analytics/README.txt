The Data Given by Oasis-infobyte for this internship is: 

Original Internship Dataset (Oasis Infobyte):  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

Dataset used for this project (relevant to autocomplete/autocorrect): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedtoba22/auto-correct-dataset?select=auto_correct.txt

The dataset contains a large collection of misspelled words paired with corrected words, suitable for training and evaluating autocorrect algorithms.



Notes by Nahom

This project uses a Kaggle dataset directly related to autocomplete and autocorrect tasks, rather than the original credit card dataset suggested.

Focus is on demonstrating practical NLP skills and building predictive models for text correction.
